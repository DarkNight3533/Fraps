# FNF on Heaps

A new Friday Night Funkin' engine made with Heaps! Yeah, not Haxeflixel, but Heaps!
Made by Glintfish, and (as of writing) exclusively Glintfish.

This engine is meant to serve as an alternative to other engines, like [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) without the intense bloat and softmoddability, [FPS Plus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public/tree/master) without the high memory usage, [Forever Engine](https://github.com/silvashp/Forever-Engine-Legacy) without the... actually, I don't know, I never used this engine.

## What is Heaps?

Heaps is a haxe, cross platform engine made for high performance games. It supports both 2D and 3D, and it's been used to make a ton of games, such as Dead Cells. You can find more, open-source games at [Heaps.io](https://heaps.io/documentation/full-game-samples.html)

## How do I install and run FNF on Heaps?
### ***THIS WILL BE ADDED SOON!***
For now, you may read through the source code, or try and compile it yourself until I make a tutorial / guide for the more uneducated folk.

## *The rest of this README is a W.I.P!*
