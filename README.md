# FNF on Heaps

A new Friday Night Funkin' engine made with Heaps! Yeah, not Haxeflixel, but Heaps!
Made by Glintfish, and (as of writing) exclusively Glintfish.

This engine is meant to serve as an alternative to other engines, like [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) without the intense bloat and softmoddability, [FPS Plus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public/tree/master) without the high memory usage, [Forever Engine](https://github.com/silvashp/Forever-Engine-Legacy) without the... actually, I don't know, I never used this engine.

## What is Heaps?

Heaps is a haxe, cross platform engine made for high performance games. It supports both 2D and 3D, and it's been used to make a ton of games, such as Dead Cells. You can find more, open-source games at [Heaps.io](https://heaps.io/documentation/full-game-samples.html)

## How do I install and run FNF on Heaps?
### ***THIS WILL BE ADDED SOON!***
For now, you may read through the source code, or try and compile it yourself until I make a tutorial / guide for the more uneducated folk.

--------------------------
# P.S.
### It needs to be noted that I am only making this engine open-source at such an early stage is because I am very much open to suggestions, improvements, and more, especially when it comes to stuff like this.
### You may see shitty code somewhere (or everywhere), and that's okay. Please don't write to me or make PRs regarding "bad code" unless I don't change it or improve it for some time (I either forgot or genuinely think what I wrote is good). I have a very weird style of coding, where I'll just make something work, doesn't matter how, it just has to work. I basically just build the foundation of everything, move on to something else, then, when needed, I go back and rewrite the older parts.

### Another thing is that I'm mainly making this engine to learn Heaps and more proper game development outside of modding. I don't actually know how good this engine will be to use, if people will use it at all, or if it'll just be thrown into the "Engines people don't even look at" area, and again, that's okay. I appreciate anyone and everyone who stops by to check this engine out!
